# To-Do

> return back to [README](../README.md#documentation)

## Gameplay Tweaks
- [ ] Zed Gun disintegrates Explosive Gunner projectiles
- [ ] Flamethrower/Explosive damage blows up Explosive Gunner projectiles
- [ ] Mutator configurations to add:
   - [ ] Restore old Headshot function
   - [ ] Restore old Wave System(if possible)
   - [ ] Disable Health Scaling
   - [ ] Option to enable Hardpat
- [ ] Play minigun whirring sound when Ranged Pound enters prefire animation so that it's less unexpected.
- [ ] Ranged Pounds that have LoS timed out from their attack should fire nearly immediately after making contact with the player.
- [ ] Create an alternative Minigun Pound variant that does not use Incendiary rounds
- [ ] Explosive Pound spawns alongside Fleshpounds
- [ ] Add additional Siren "explosive block" state in controller similar to Fleshpound Spinstate that causes each explosive within range to explode.
- [ ] Redo animation for RangedPreFireMG, removing excessive head shake and point minigun accurately
- [ ] Mirror Scrake melee animation for Explosive Pound(probably never?)
- [ ] Make Fleshpound Avoid Area's only spawn when enraged and make Avoid Area extend a couple of meters infront of Fleshpounds to make zeds "Clear the way"
  - Currently, Fleshpound Avoid Area has been temporarily removed until this is done.
- [ ] Fix TWI's Scrake Slow Rage bug(if possible).

## Bugs
- Bloat Puke Damtype bugs out Bilebomb and puking generally for an unknown reasson
- Bloat puke can be seen through walls(KFMod issue).
- Bloat deals inaccurate damage in Bilebomb(two hits instead of one)
- Clot still uses clawing animations on door instead of grappling

## Miscellaneous

- [ ] (Vel) Check for compatibility with Scrake [Spin Fix Mut](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2046199794) (Or other muts e.g. Hard Pat, Texture mods etc... (?))
- [ ] Create HardPat version of Patty toggleable via bEnableHardPat option.
