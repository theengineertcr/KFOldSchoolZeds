Brings back the UT2004 zeds from KFMod 2.5 to Retail! Includes bonus zed "Fleshpound Chaingunner" as a Husk replacement and "Fleshpound Explosive Gunner", and a bonus zed inspired by the Quake 1 Ogre(Chainsaw arm, grenade launcher!) and Quake 2 Gunner(Fires multiple nades!).

To play, select "Killing Floor" Game, enable the mutator in the mutator page and configure as desired.

For server owners: Mutator=KF25OSMut

Additional configuration to be added in later versions. Planned variables include: Toggle of each zeds old behavior, old headshot behavior, old health, speed & damage values, and more.
