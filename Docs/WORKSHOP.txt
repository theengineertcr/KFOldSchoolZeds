Brings back the UT2004 zeds from KFMod 2.5 to Retail! Includes bonus zed "Fleshpound Chaingunner" as a Husk replacement and "Fleshpound Explosive Gunner", a bonus zed inspired by the Quake 1 Ogre(Chainsaw arm, grenade launcher!) and Quake 2 Gunner(Fires multiple nades!).

To play, select "Killing Floor" Game, enable the mutator in the mutator page and configure as desired.

For server owners: Mutator=KFOldSchoolZeds.KF25OSMut

You may configure variables in the KFOldSchoolZeds.ini or the mutator options page. As of now, Zed corpses in solo cannot be shot as it was a bit buggy to begin with and resulted in people wasting ammo trying to kill crawlers. You can still shoot them online, but it will not eat your shots.
