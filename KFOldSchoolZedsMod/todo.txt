Gameplay Tweaks
〇 Scrake melee attack 1 should be preferred when raged on Suicidal+
   Attack 1 to deal less damage(20%?) as its faster and hits twice in quick succession
   Attack 2 to deal a bit more damage(10-15%?) as it hits a 5 frames slower compared to Attack 1,
   
〇 Clot to use clawing animations on door instead of grappling
   Review each Zed's door attack behavior in general to make sure they're using the correct animation
   
〇 Prevent zeds from turning their whole body to face the player when knocked down(turn off targetting?)

〇 Meleestun/Hit animation immunity during knockdown(they're knocked on their ass so they shouldn't suddenly stand up and start moving around)

〇 Get rid of Fleshpound's AvoidArea.


Bugs to be fixed
〇 FleshPound dealing continuous damage post-rage(online?) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItSdKJu7KXE
   Potentially to do with a Vanilla Fleshpound bug where the Fleshpound stands aimlessly next to a player
   Without attempting to melee them. In this case, however, the Fleshpound's melee distance is so short that 
   He gets close enough to the player to bump into and obliterate them. Fix: Increase melee range?
   
〇 Zeds do not play TakeHit animations, possibly because of OldPlayHit being commented out?
   Review KFMonster and KFMonsterOS
   
〇 Zeds have buggier pathing compared to KF zeds for an unknown reason. Reevalaute individual zed classes and Controller class.


Misc.
〇 Rename all zed names to to "Zed Name 2.5"
