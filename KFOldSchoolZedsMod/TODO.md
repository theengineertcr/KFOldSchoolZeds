# Gameplay Tweaks
 - Make Fleshpound Avoid Area's only spawn when enraged and make Avoid Area extend a couple of meters infront of Fleshpounds to make zeds "Clear the way" 
   - Currently, Fleshpound Avoid Area has been temporarily removed until this is done.
 - Fleshpound/Ranged Pound head hitboxes too generous
 - Bloat acid stays for far too long.


# Bugs
 - FleshPound dealing continuous damage post-rage(online?) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItSdKJu7KXE 
   - Attempted fix is now in place.
   - May have to do with the Spin Damage? Mayeb temporarily disable attack 3 to see if that's the case?
 - Zeds have buggier pathing compared to KF zeds for an unknown reason(Seen around KF-Offices typical hallway camp spot)
 - Many Zed head hitboxes online are broken/don't work properly.
 
# Miscellaneous
 - Check for compatibility with Scrake [Spin Fix Mut](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2046199794) (Or other muts e.g. Hard Pat, Texture mods etc... (?))
